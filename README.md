## Background of the Company
AltiQ Hardware has grown substantially in recent years, expanding its global presence. The company specializes in distributing computers and computer accessories through three different channels:
* Retailers
* Direct
* Distributors

Recently, the company incurred an unexpected loss due to opening a store in America. This decision was based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Additionally, competitors of the company possess dedicated analytics teams to make data-driven decisions. Therefore, AltiQ Hardware has recognized the necessity of establishing its analytics team to gain insights and make informed decisions to thrive in the industry.

## Data Import in Power BI
In this project, we will import data from a MySQL database into Power BI using appropriate database access credentials.

## Data Model
* Data modeling is crucial as it serves as the foundation for reports. Visuals are created based on the data model.
* Improper data modeling can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the report.
* We have utilized the Snowfall data modeling method in this project.
